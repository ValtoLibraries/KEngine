# [LuaComponent](LuaComponent.hpp)

`Component` that specifies the list of lua scripts to be run for the `GameObject` it is attached to.

Scripts can use the `self` global variable to access the `GameObject` they are attached to.


> /!\ Calling `createEntity` or `removeEntity` from a script attached to a `GameObject` will result in the entity being created or remove **only at the end of the current frame**. This is necessary to avoid memory corruption errors, as the newly created entities could invalidate iterators in the collection of entities being currently iterated on by the [LuaSystem](../systems/LuaSystem.md).


Inherits from [putils::Reflectible](https://github.com/phiste/putils/blob/master/reflection/Reflectible.md).

In all the following functions, a `script` is the path to a file containing a script, NOT THE ACTUAL SCRIPT CODE.

### Members

##### Constructor

```

##### getScripts
